Development of a Console-based Snake Game in C++

Designed and implemented a classic Snake game in C++ using object-oriented principles. Key features include:

  * Real-time game mechanics with dynamic rendering of the game field and snake movement.
  * User input handling for controlling the snake's direction.
  * Collision detection for game over conditions and fruit consumption.
  * Score tracking and tail growth mechanism upon eating the fruit.
  * Utilized the Windows console for rendering and the conio.h library for capturing keyboard inputs.
